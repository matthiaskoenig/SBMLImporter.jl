# [Supported SBML Features](@id support)

SBMLImporter supports many SBML features for models of level 2 or higher. Currently, excluding FBA models it successfully passes 1265 out of 1785 test cases. The failed test cases cover features currently not supported. Key features supported include:

- Events.
- Rate rules.
- Assignment rules.
- Algebraic rules.
- Dynamic compartment size.
- Species and model conversion factors.

Species can be specified in either concentrations or amounts. The unit is determined as follows:

- If `initialConcentration` is set for a species, its unit will be set to concentration.
- If `initialAmount` is set for a species, it will be treated as being in amount.
- If neither is set, and the `substanceUnits` of the species is "substance," it is treated as being in amounts.

Currently SBMLImporter does not support the following features:

* Delay (creating a delay-differential-equations).
* Events with delay.
* Events with priority.
* Hierarchical models.
* Fast reactions.
* Parameter or species names corresponding to Julia constants (`pi`, `Inf`, `NaN`, `true`, `false`).
* Certain uncommon math expressions, such as `lt` with three arguments, `implies` etc...

Import might also fail for complicated nested piecewise expressions inside SBML functions.

## Support for additional features

If SBMLImporter lacks support for a feature you would like to have, please file an issue on GitHub.
